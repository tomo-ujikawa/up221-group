**Project title and link to proposal Title:** LA County TOD Assessment  
**Proposal link:** https://github.com/tomo-ujikawa/up221-group/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/GroupAssignment1.md

**Roles:**  
Tomo: manager: coordinating submissions and meetings  
Simon: LA transportation specialist: leading overall framing of the project  
Xinyi: data analyst: leading data analysis approach and booking meeting rooms  
Alain: international transportation consultant: specialized in visualization and creating attractive maps  

**Status update:** GREAT!  
What is working: Group spirit. All members share similar vibes and goals for this course and work collaboratively.  
What is not working: creativity level might be low. Thereâ€™s no data informal science specialist in our team.

**Data update:**   
The project will mainly focus on LA County, the data sources will thus be primarily IPUMS (), US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/) and Neighborhood Data for Social Change (https://map.myneighborhooddata.org/).

**Concerns:**   
Major concerns:  
Clarify the research question  
How to identify and quantify overlapping areas of census tract and .5 mile radius 

Minor concerns:  
Data that identifies TOD areas  
Doing the ratio of the intersect => is it really reliable to represent the population
