## Research Topic
- What are the population characteristics of transit corridor households vs transit desert households in LA county?
- In LA County, which areas have the greatest need and potential for TOD development?

## Why This Matters
The Los Angeles Metropolitan Area is the second most populous metropolitan area in the United States. Its congestion-infested, car-oriented urbansphere is a result of a lack of public transit options. With the growing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to implement sustainable solutions, the pressure to develop a public transportation network has never been greater. In response to the falling ridership, TOD (Transit-Oriented Development), based on a rail and BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) network, has been promoted in LA. While public investment budgets are limited due to austerity policies, these infrastructure developments need significant investment, prioritization, and political decision-making. We believe that analyzing the characteristics of existing rail and BRT transit corridor areas and other areas with high potential and need for TOD development is essential for future TOD planning.

## Spatial Scope
**LA County**:  The biggest transit agency in the LA Metropolitan Area is LA Metro, which operates within the boundaries of LA county. Our analysis will hence focus on Metro transit services with LA County as the scope for our study. Even within a single county, LA County, each neighborhood's social composition and built environment characteristics are diverse. Prioritization is necessary when considering the development of transportation infrastructure, and analysis of geographical distribution and characteristics of population and built environment is essential in developing transportation infrastructure plans. Since the planning for the transportation infrastructure was created over several decades ago, it is not only crucial to understand current ridership patterns, but also critical to predict future ridership needs. Although forecasting the future is not within the scope of our research, we believe that understanding past change patterns over time will reveal spatial patterns that hold true to this day. 

## Intended Analysis and Visualizations
We define “TOD corridor” as within half-mile of a rail/BRT station.

## Data Sources
We will use the age distribution, car ownership, median income, household size and demography data from this data source titled [Neighborhood Data for Social Change](https://map.myneighborhooddata.org/). The data are compiled by census tracts, and this dataset includes data from 2010 to 2021.  
We will use the city map and geographic data from this data source of [LA City](https://data.lacity.org/browse).  
We will use the rail & BRT line stop data, 2022 median income (census tract), and 2023 household percentage without vehicles (census tract) from this data source titled [GeoHub](https://geohub.lacity.org/).

## Conclusion
By visualizing the social and demographic characteristics and geographic distribution of TOD and non-TOD corridors within LA County, we expect to be able to identify the development needs and feasible areas for TOD in LA.
